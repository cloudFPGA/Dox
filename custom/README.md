# cF API

This is the documentation of the cF sources in Doxygen style.

## What's new?
Curious about what was added or improved recently? Check out the Changelog.

## Getting started
The best way to get started is to read the thorough guide to download, build, install and start using cFDK. 
Currently we provide building support for Linux. After that, there are various [tutorials](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Doc/pages/GETTING_STARTED/getting_started.html) and [exemplary projects](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Doc/pages/PROJECTS/cfprojects.html#project-repositories).
In addition, this documentation page is the best place to navigate into all code semantics of cFDK. 
Specifically, looking into the [cloudFPGA module](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Dox/group__cF.html), one can explore the files, macros, functions and variables of the various submodules.

### cloudFPGA example applications

cloudFPGA projects (**cFp_**) are provided to demonstrate the usage of the cFDK and to provide some code for learning.

Currently, the following cFps are provided:

* [cFp_HelloKale](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Doc/pages/PROJECTS/cFp_HelloKale.html)
* [cFp_HelloThemisto](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Doc/pages/PROJECTS/cFp_HelloThemisto.html)
* [cFp_Zoo](https://cloudfpga.github.io/Doc/pages/PROJECTS/cFp_Zoo.html)
