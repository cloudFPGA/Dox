# cloudFPGA Development Kit (cFDK) API

The **cloudFPGA Development Kit (cFDK)** provides all the design files that are necessary to create a new cloudFPGA application, also called **cloudFPGA project (cFp)**.

cloudFPGA is designed to support different types of *Shells (SHELL or SHL)* and *FPGA Modules (MOD)*.
Before creating a new cFp, a designer must decide for a SHELL and a MOD, both are explained in the documentation section.

To set up a new cFp properly, the *cloudFPGA Build Framework* (cFBuild) is highly recommended!

## What's new?
Curious about what was added or improved recently? Check out the Changelog.

## Getting started
The best way to get started is to read the thorough guide to download, build, install and start using cFDK. 
Currently we provide building support for Linux. After that, there are various tutorials and examples.
In addition, this documentation page is the best place to navigate into all code semantics of cFDK.

### cloudFPGA example applications

Example applications (**APP**) are provided to demonstrate the usage of this Development Kit and to provide some code for learning.

Currently, the cFDK includes the following example APPs:

* `triangle_app`: To build a triangle cluster
